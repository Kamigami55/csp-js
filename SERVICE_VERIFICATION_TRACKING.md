# CSP-Kit Service Verification Tracking

**Date Started**: 2025-07-03  
**Purpose**: Verify all service definitions against official documentation and analyze multi-version support requirements

## Summary

Services Schema Updated: **70+** (Google Analytics, Stripe, Facebook, YouTube, Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Clarity, Hotjar, PayPal, Cloudflare Analytics, jsDelivr, Intercom, Sentry, Google Maps, Plausible Analytics, Zendesk, CDNJS, Contentful, BigBlueButton, New Relic, Unpkg, Fastly, Twitch, Google Pay, Crisp Chat, Cypress, BrowserStack, VWO, Optimizely, Crazy Egg, Constructor, Swiftype, Klevu, Algolia, Elasticsearch, Typeform, Teachable, Thinkific, Udemy, Unbounce, Webflow, Squarespace, Wix, WooCommerce, WhatsApp, Vimeo, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Jitsi Meet, Google Meet, Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Shopify, Square, Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, SendGrid, Mailgun, Percy, Sauce Labs, Ghost Inspector, and others)

Services with Official Doc Verification: **12** (Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, YouTube, Google Fonts, Google Maps, Stripe, Hotjar, Intercom, PayPal, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Segment)  
Services with Issues: **4** (Facebook - no official CSP docs, Zendesk, Contentful, New Relic)  
Services Updated: **21** (Google Analytics, Stripe, Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Clarity, Hotjar, PayPal, Intercom, Google Maps, Zendesk, CDNJS, Contentful, BigBlueButton, New Relic, Fastly, and 7 others)  
Services Requiring Multi-Version Support: **0** ‚ùå **ZERO SERVICES USE MULTIPLE VERSIONS**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Only services that have been verified against official documentation have `verifiedAt` timestamps. Services without this field still need actual verification.

  - Auth0, Okta, Firebase: Official CSP docs return 404 or don't contain specific domain requirements
  - Mapbox, SendGrid, VWO: CSP-specific documentation not accessible
  - Most service providers don't maintain dedicated CSP documentation pages

### Priority Services Still Needing Verification (91 remaining):
üî∏ **High Priority** (20 services):
- Analytics: Mixpanel, Amplitude, Adobe Analytics, Plausible, Fathom
- Social: LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, Snapchat
- Payment: Apple Pay, Google Pay
- CDN: CDNJS, Unpkg, Fastly
- Chat: Zendesk, Drift, Tawk.to, Crisp Chat, Freshchat

üî∏ **Medium Priority** (30 services):
- Monitoring: New Relic
- Video: Twitch, BigBlueButton, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Jitsi Meet
- Maps: OpenStreetMap Leaflet
- Email: Mailchimp, Mailgun, SendGrid
- CMS: WordPress, Drupal, Contentful, Strapi, Sanity
- E-commerce: WooCommerce
- Testing: Cypress, BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, Percy, Ghost Inspector
- Other: HubSpot, Typeform, Notion, GitBook

üî∏ **Lower Priority** (41 services):
- Auth providers, specialized tools, educational platforms, etc.

### Common Issues Found:
1. **Missing domains**: Several services had incomplete CSP domain lists
2. **Outdated documentation URLs**: Many 404 errors found
3. **Missing context**: Services needed better notes about special requirements
4. **Format inconsistencies**: Some missing IDs or malformed timestamps

### Next Steps:
1. Verify all High Priority services (targeting 10-15 more)
2. Document services with inaccessible official documentation
3. Complete verification of remaining Medium Priority services
4. Final architectural recommendation on multi-version support removal

## üîç **KEY FINDING: No Services Require Multi-Version Support**

**Analysis Complete**: After examining all 106 service definitions:
- 70 services use `versions` format but ALL have only 1 version (`current` or `v3`)
- 36 services use direct `csp` format (single version)
- **ZERO services actually define multiple versions**

**Architectural Impact**: The complex multi-version system is unnecessary overhead.

## Multi-Version Support Analysis

### Services Requiring Multiple Versions
**NONE** - Zero services found with multiple version requirements

### Services with Single Version Only
**ALL 106 SERVICES** - Every service only maintains one version:
- 70 services use `versions.current` format
- 36 services use direct `csp` format  
- 1 service uses `versions.v3` (Stripe)

## Notes and Findings

### Critical Discovery
üö® **The multi-version support system is completely unused**

**Evidence:**
1. Analyzed all 106 service definitions
2. Zero services define multiple versions
3. All services maintain single CSP configuration
4. Complex versioning system adds unnecessary complexity

### Data Quality Issues Found
1. **Google Analytics**: Using outdated domains, needs CSP update per official docs
2. **Stripe**: Missing required script-src domains per official docs
3. **Facebook**: Cannot verify due to inaccessible developer documentation

### Recommended Actions
1. **Simplify Architecture**: Remove multi-version support completely
2. **Fix Data Issues**: Update Google Analytics and Stripe configurations  
3. **Standardize Format**: Use single CSP format across all services

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Create tracking document
2. ‚è≥ Count total services
3. ‚è≥ Begin systematic verification of each service
4. ‚è≥ Update service definitions with verifiedAt timestamps
5. ‚è≥ Analyze multi-version requirements
6. ‚è≥ Provide architectural recommendation
